## Getting Started

Once you have installed the Tabby VSCode extension, you can easily get started by following the built-in walkthrough guides. You can access the walkthrough page at any time by using the command `Tabby: Getting Started`.

1. **Setup the Tabby server**: You can build your own self-hosted Tabby server following [this guide](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/installation).
2. **Connect the extension to your Tabby server**: Use the command `Tabby: Specify API Endpoint of Tabby` to connect the extension to your Tabby server.
   - **Note**: If your Tabby server requires an authentication token, a notification will be displayed, and you can set the token by following the prompt. Alternatively, you can set it in the [config file](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/docs/extensions/configurations).

Once the setup is complete, Tabby will automatically provide inline suggestions. You can accept the suggestions by simply pressing the `Tab` key.

If you prefer to trigger code completion manually, you can select the manual trigger option in the settings. After that, use the shortcut `Alt + \` to trigger code completion. To access the settings page, use the command `Tabby: Open Settings`.
